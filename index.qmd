Welcome! Iâ€™m a former political scientist turned data scientist. My PhD research involved developing Bayesian statistical models to measure latent traits in political groups and individuals, as well as on how to integrate uncertainty from these models into downstream analysis. For more on what I am working on lately, feel free check out my [blog](https://www.bwilden.com/blog)!

Hobbies I like to do while waiting for my MCMC chains to finish include gardening, running, camping, and watching cheesy rom-coms.
