Hello! I am a PhD data scientist specializing in Bayesian modeling methods. My research involves building statistical models to measure latent variables such as political ideology, and developing methods for incorporating the uncertainty from these measurements into downstream analysis. This blog is for showcasing some of my research and other odd quantitative projects I am working on.

When I'm waiting for my MCMC chains to finish I like to rock climb, play board games, and go backpacking.
