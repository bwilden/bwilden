Hi! I am a data scientist and PhD Candidate at UC San Diego finishing up a degree in Political Science. My research involves building Bayesian statistical models to measure latent variables such as political ideology, and developing methods for incorporating the uncertainty from these measurements into downstream analysis. I am also interested in open source software development in R.

When I'm waiting for my MCMC chains to finish I like to rock climb, play board games, and go backpacking.
