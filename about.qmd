Hi! I am a PhD Candidate at UC San Diego working on a degree in Political Science with a Specialization in Computational Social Science. My research involves building Bayesian statistical models to measure latent variables such as political ideology. I am also interested in open source software development in R.

When waiting for my MCMC chains to finish I like to rock climb, play board games, and go backpacking.
